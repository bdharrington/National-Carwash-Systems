# About This Repository

This repository is a base frame work implementing the PackML standard by OMAC specifically the ANSI/ISA-TR88.00.02-2015 ISA88 for machine control. It is freely shared as a base to begin new projects from in an effort to make project coding more efficient and to allow developers to begin coding their specific machine faster by not needing to setup a new project structure for each new project.
